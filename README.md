# WeatherApp
WeatherApp in SwiftUI, created following the [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2W9MPjrIbk) by DesignCode.

Improvements made:
- Realtime date
- Match the icon displayed to the actual weather
- Immediately show weather view if the user has already granted location permissions
